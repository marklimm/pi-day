A leaderboard application for company's 3/14 "pi" day "pie in the face" contest

http://pi-day.parseapp.com/

At my previous job there was a 3/14 "pi" day "pie in the face" contest where employees could buy votes to vote for which manager they wanted to have get a pie thrown in their face!  This application is a real-time leaderboard implemented with knockoutJS, using firebase as a real-time backend.  It was very well-received and people being able to get real-time updates on the contest helped to drive enthusiasm and vote purchases for the event.  

The main page displays the leaderboard itself - clearly illustrating the rules that all managers in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or last place would get a pie in the face :) - as well as a "news feed" of every set of votes that were tallied

There is also an admin portion for adding to the vote tallies
