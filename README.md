A leaderboard application for company's 3/14 "pi" day "pie in the face" contest

http://pi-day.parseapp.com/

At my previous job there was a 3/14 "pi" day "pie in the face" contest where employees could buy votes to vote for which manager they wanted to have get a pie thrown in their face!  This application is a real-time leaderboard implemented with knockoutJS, using firebase as a real-time backend.  It was very well-received and people being able to get real-time updates on the contest helped to drive enthusiasm and vote purchases for the event.  

There is also an admin portion for adding to the vote tallies
