At a previous job there was a 3/14 "pi" day "pie in the face" contest where employees could buy votes to vote for which manager they wanted to have get a pie thrown in their face!  This application is a real-time leaderboard implemented with knockoutJS, using firebase as a real-time backend.  

There is also an admin portion for adding to the vote tallies
